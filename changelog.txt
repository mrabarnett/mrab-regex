    Now exports Match object as well as Pattern object.

    Git issue 414: Memory optimization questions

    sys.getsizeof returns a more accurate size of a pattern object. It includes the size of internal data, but, as is the norm, does not include the size of public objects.

Version: 2021.4.4

    Git issue 408: regex fails with a quantified backreference but succeeds with repeated backref
    Git issue 407: API is not a drop-in replacement for python's re when it comes to typing

    The problem was caused by a lazy repeat looping forever, growing the backtracking stack. Greedy repeats were OK.

Version: 2020.7.14

    Git issue 377: request: \h for horizontal space

    Added \h as an alias to [[:blank:]].

Version: 2020.6.7

    Improved performance of string sets.

Version: 2020.6.7

    Git issue 376: Is the \L option as efficient as it can be?

Version: 2020.5.14

    Git issue 372: Regression from 2020.4.4 -> 2020.5.7 in non-fuzzy matching pattern

    Changed the 'state' member that's tested in is_repeat_guarded for a fuzzy match. The previously-used member wasn't initialised in a non-fuzzy match. The new test is a better one to use anyway.

Version: 2020.5.13

    Git issue 371: Specifying character set when fuzzy-matching allows characters not in the set

    fuzzy_ext_match and fuzzy_ext_match_group_fld didn't support sets!

Version: 2019.6.2

    Updated to Unicode 12.1.0.

Version: 2019.5.25

    Hg issue 326: Version is out of sync with PyPI

Version: 2019.3.12

    Hg issue 319: Support for a timespan parameter

    Added timeout parameter in Python 3. TimeoutError was added in Python 3.3, and as Python 2.7 will soon reach EOL, I'm not bothered about supporting timeouts for Python 2.

Version: 2019.3.9

    Hg issue 320: Abnormal performance

    Forgot about negative lookarounds! Previous change now applies only to positive lookarounds.

Version: 2019.3.8

    Hg issue 320: Abnormal performance

    Hg issue 308: infinite search

    Fixed a re-allocation bug.

    Major overhaul of code to use simpler stacks. The result is now much easier to understand and maintain!

Version: 2018.11.22

    Hg issue 304: Unreasonable edge case that used to work

    Now moves the minimum number of repeats out of a repeat if it contains a repeat. This allows a repeat guard to be put back, which reduces the chance of catastrophic backtracking.

Version: 2018.11.7

    Hg issue 301: TypeError: character mapping must return integer, None or unicode

    Fixed bug introduced by broken workflow.

Version: 2018.11.6

Version: 2018.6.21

    Hg issue 286: Regex matches with `re` but not with `regex` module

Version: 2018.6.20

    The reported positions of fuzzy changes were sometimes incorrect.

Version: 2017.1.17

    Hg issue 230: Is it a bug of (?(DEFINE)...)

    Capture groups in (?(DEFINE)...) shouldn't be treated as 'visible' capture groups by .findall.

Version: 2017.1.14

    Hg issue 227: Performance trap of (?V1i) flags

    Further improvements. It now tries to split full case-folded literals into simple and full case-folded literals where full case-folding isn't needed because simple case-folding is faster.

Version: 2017.1.13

    Hg issue 227: Performance trap of (?V1i) flags

Version: 2016.10.22

    Hg issue 221: Got an exception using PyPy

    pypy2-v5.4.1 appears not to support the buffer protocol on bytestrings (str in Python 2), so added code to handle them analogously to how unicode strings are handled.

Version: 2016.10.20

    Make setup use setuptools if it's available.

Version: 2016.10.12

    Hg issue 221: Got an exception using PyPy

    Added check for error in fold_case which, I hope, will reveal the exception that it's not reporting.

Version: 2016.9.22

    Hg issue 220: Misbehavior of group capture with OR operand

    Repeats should not be factored out of branches because a branch should be exhausted before trying the next one.

Version: 2016.9.13

    Also supported on Python 3.6.

Version: 2016.8.27

    Hg issue 219: Unicode word boundries

    For a Unicode word boundary (UAX #29), apostrophe in rule WB5a should include both U+0027 (APOSTROPHE) and U+2019 (RIGHT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK /
     * curly apostrophe).

Version: 2016.7.21

    Info about atomic groups wasn't pushed properly.

Version: 2016.6.5

    Hg issue 212: Unexpected matching difference with .*? between re and regex

    In 'add_repeat_guards', it wasn't propagating the status from the tail back towards the head across default nodes, so the guards weren't always correct.

Version: 2016.6.2

    Hg issue 211: Segmentation fault with recursive matches and atomic groups

    It wasn't saving the call frame and then restoring it when backtracking out of atomic groups.

Version: 2016.5.23

    Hg issue 206: Incompatible with re if single { in the pattern

    Brought the regex module's handling more in line with the re module. It now more readily treats an invalid fuzzy constraint as a literal.

Version: 2016.5.15

    Hg issue 208: Named list, (?ri) flags, Backreference

    Fixed more issues with the alignment of text in a buffer when using named lists.

    Also changed how a compiled regex is pickled to use a bytestring for the packed code list. (It was actually pickling an unpacked list of ints.)

Version: 2016.5.14

    Hg issue 205: Named list and (?ri) flags

    string_set_match_ign_fwdrev wasn't taking into account that it fills the folded buffer from the end when searching in reverse.

Version: 2016.5.13

    Hg issue 204: confusion of (?aif) flags

    The FULLCASE flag is now ignored if the ASCII flag is turned on.

    Removed copies of groups that weren't called.

Version: 2016.4.3

    Hg issue 197: ValueError in regex.compile
    Hg issue 198: ValueError in regex.compile

    It wasn't catching ValueError and then raising regex.error.

Version: 2016.4.2

    Hg issue 196: Fuzzy matching on repeated regex not working as expected

    Also reduced memory usage of pickle data.

Version: 2016.3.31

    # Hg issue #194: .FULLCASE and Backreference

    Capture groups failed to match when using full case folding because of a bug in the handling of "I", which needs to be treated specially to cope with the Turkic I).

Version: 2016.3.26

    Hg issue #193: Alternation and .REVERSE flag.

    The firstset before a branch was at the wrong end for a reverse pattern.

Version: 2016.3.2

    Hg issue 190: Regression? Neverending regexp when upgrading to latest version.

    The fix for Hg issue 187 wasn't quite right. Managed to remove recursion entirely from 'add_repeat_guards'.

Version: 2016.2.25

    Hg issue 188: Crash during search

    Stopped calling 'try_match' recursively when the tail of a branch is a branch. Increasing alternatives to 40000 caused the stack to overflow.

Version: 2016.2.24

    Hg issue 187: Crash on Anaconda Python if large number of pattern

    Remove the recursion in 'use_nodes'. Increasing alternatives to 50000 caused the stack to overflow.

Version: 2016.2.23

    Hg issue 187: Crash on Anaconda Python if large number of pattern

    Reduced the amount of recursion in 'add_repeat_guards'. The large number of alternatives (25154) caused the stack to overflow.

Version: 2016.1.10

    Hg issue 177: Build fails on pypy (OS X 10.11, clang)

    Stripped out the #if...#endif that was added for Hg issue 135, which is no longer needed by more recent versions of PyPy.

    The groups and repeats weren't restored properly when a lookaround completed and it contained a group call.

    Nested lookarounds/atomic groups didn't restore state correctly.

Version: 2015.7.20

    Hg issue #147: Fuzzy match can return match points beyond buffer end

Version: 2015.7.12

    Hg issue #146: Forced-fail (?!) works improperly in conditional

    Empty negative lookarounds weren't optimised correctly.

    The capture groups weren't being cleared before retrying after failure.

    Hg issue #141: Crash on a certain partial match

    It didn't check the result of 'try_match' correctly in certain places (the status returned isn't limited to success and failure).

Version: 2015.6.9

    Hg issue #140: Replace with REVERSE and groups has unexpected behavior

    subx needed to add the template items to the list in reverse order when searching backwards because the list will be reversed after completion.

    Hg issue #137: Posix character class :punct: does not seem to be supported

    It _is_ supported.

    Corrected Posix-style properties for 'alnum', 'digit', 'punct' and 'xdigit' which are different from that of Unicode. Now also available as \p[posix_alnum}, etc.

    Hg issue  #138: grapheme anchored search not working properly

    Fixed.

Version: 2015.5.10

    Hg issue #136: Use a DFA when possible

    Made a slight tweak so that it now treats an optional subpattern like a repeated subpattern (e.g. "(?:xyz)?" -> "(?:xyz){0,1}") to make use of the repeat guards.

    The advantage over DFA is that it'll work even for those patterns that aren't compatible with DFA.

Version: 2015.5.7

    Hg issue 135: PyPy Support (with patch)

    It should now build on PyPy.
